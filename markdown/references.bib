abstract ={Human IgG4 antibody shows therapeutically-useful properties compared to the IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 subclasses. Thus IgG4 does not activate complement, and shows conformational variability. These properties are attributable to its hinge region, which is the shortest of the four IgG subclasses. Using high throughput scattering methods, we have studied the solution structure of wild-type IgG4(Ser222) and a hinge mutant IgG4(Pro222) in different buffers and temperatures, where the proline substitution suppresses the formation of half-antibody. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that both IgG4 forms were principally monomeric with sedimentation coefficients s020,w of 6.6-6.8 S. A monomer-dimer equilibrium was observed in heavy water buffer at low temperature. Scattering showed that the X-ray radius of gyration RG was unchanged with concentration in 50-250 mM NaCl buffers, while the neutron RG values showed a concentration-dependent increase as the temperature decreased in heavy water buffers. The distance distribution curves P(r) revealed two peaks, M1 and M2 that shifted below 2 mg/ml to indicate concentration-dependent IgG4 structures, in addition to IgG4 dimer formation at high concentration in heavy water. Constrained X-ray and neutron scattering modelling revealed asymmetric solution structures for IgG4(Ser222) with extended hinge structures. The IgG4(Pro222) structure was similar. Both IgG4 structures showed that their Fab regions were positioned close enough to the Fc region to restrict C1q binding. Our new molecular models for IgG4 explain its inability to activate complement, and clarifies aspects of its stability and function for therapeutic applications.},

Of the four human IgG antibody subclasses IgG1–IgG4, IgG4 is of interest in that it does not activate complement and exhibits atypical self-association, including the formation of bispecific antibodies. The solution structures of antibodies are critical to understand function and therapeutic applications. Thus IgG4 was studied by synchrotron X-ray scattering. The Guinier X-ray radius of gyration RG increased from 5.0 nm to 5.1 nm with an increase of concentration. The distance distribution function P(r) revealed a single peak at 0.3 mg/ml, which resolved into two peaks that shifted to smaller r values at 1.3 mg/ml, even though the maximum dimension of IgG4 was unchanged at 17 nm. This indicated a small concentration dependence of the IgG4 solution structure. By analytical ultracentrifugation, no concentration dependence in the sedimentation coefficient of 6.4 S was observed. Constrained scattering modelling resulted in solution structural determinations that showed that IgG4 has an asymmetric solution structure in which one Fab–Fc pair is closer together than the other pair, and the accessibility of one side of the Fc region is masked by the Fab regions. The averaged distances between the two Fab–Fc pairs change by 1–2 nm with the change in IgG4 concentration. The averaged conformation of the Fab regions appear able to hinder complement C1q binding to the Fc region and the self-association of IgG4 through the Fc region. The present results clarify IgG4 function and provide a starting point to investigate antibody stability.

doi = {10.1093/nar/gku340}, 
abstract ={Protein structure homology modelling has become a routine technique to generate 3D models for proteins when experimental structures are not available. Fully automated servers such as SWISS-MODEL with user-friendly web interfaces generate reliable models without the need for complex software packages or downloading large databases. Here, we describe the latest version of the SWISS-MODEL expert system for protein structure modelling. The SWISS-MODEL template library provides annotation of quaternary structure and essential ligands and co-factors to allow for building of complete structural models, including their oligomeric structure. The improved SWISS-MODEL pipeline makes extensive use of model quality estimation for selection of the most suitable templates and provides estimates of the expected accuracy of the resulting models. The accuracy of the models generated by SWISS-MODEL is continuously evaluated by the CAMEO system. The new web site allows users to interactively search for templates, cluster them by sequence similarity, structurally compare alternative templates and select the ones to be used for model building. In cases where multiple alternative template structures are available for a protein of interest, a user-guided template selection step allows building models in different functional states. SWISS-MODEL is available at http://swissmodel.expasy.org/.},
